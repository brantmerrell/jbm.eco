<h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
<p>I'm really excited about software, statistics, bicycles, chess, and the rewarding journey of parenthood which I am experiencing alongside my wonderful wife.</p>
<p>I'm building this to study chess in a way that helps me think about topics other than chess. I am my main test subject, but I appreciate company.</p>
<p>I'll link my content here as it becomes available.</p>
<p><em>Thanks for visiting!</em></p>
