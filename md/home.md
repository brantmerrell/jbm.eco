## Ascii Chess

This project explores data visualization capabilities and assesses data values.

The web app at [chess.jbm.eco](https://chess.jbm.eco) supports the following helper visuals:  

* **Graph View**: a network graph depiction of the chessboard
* **Arc View**: an arc depiction of FEN strings
* **Chord View**: A chord depiction of board connections (threats & protections)
* **History Table**: A comparison of algebraic, universal, and Forsyth-Edwards notations
* **FEN Character Count**: A depiction of how metrics can be compared across move sequences

The prototype at [josh-b-merrell.shinyapps.io/my-chess/](https://josh-b-merrell.shinyapps.io/my-chess/) also supports:

* **FEN Description**: A breakdown of FEN strings
* **FEN Map**: A 2-dimensional rendering of FEN strings

AWS currently routes the client-side app to a backend API which will soon be made avaiable at connector.jbm.eco.
