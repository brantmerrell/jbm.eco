I'm building apps to study chess in ways that help me think through topics other than chess.  

One that I have deployed (though am still developing) is [Ascii Chess](http://jbm.eco/ascii-chess). Some features on the way are,  

 - **The Bishop's Triangle**: the linear equations and triangles associated with diagonal-moving pieces
 - **Checkmate Pie**: a visualization of the King's options as a pie(ish) chart
 - **Piece-Agnostic Pneumonics**: The construction of shapes on the board to remember the position of pieces
 - **Tactics as Pneumonics**: The use of tactical explorations as memory devices rather than to (directly) discover best moves
 - **Platform Integration** with chess.com and lichess.org 

*Thanks for visiting!*
