title: Welcome to my site!

I'm really excited about software, statistics, bicycles, chess, and the rewarding journey of parenthood which I am experiencing alongside my wonderful wife.  

I'm building this to study chess in ways that help me think through topics other than chess. I am my main test subject, but I appreciate company.  

I'll link my content here as it becomes available.  

*Thanks for visiting!*
