## Positional Visualization 

Goal: Create visualizations that illustrate concepts behind positions.  

Positional visualization needs to be layered by skill level. Here are some examples of beginner-level visualizations: 
 - Geometric shapes
 - Single-move territory
 - Single-move connections
 - The checkmate pie chart
 - Pins?
 - Forks?
 - Discovered check?
 - ...etc

Most tactics exercises - especially at the beginner level - should be matchable to one or two visualization types. The development of these should be in ascending order of difficulty. Of course, ranking by difficulty is imprecise. But I should be able to bring up a featured tactical exercise, then choose a visualization method that illustrates the theme associated with that exercise.  

Difficult positions should often require "unpacking." That is to say, themes are often embedded in other themes. Visualizations should exist for chunking the themes into distinct visualizations and linking them together.  Something similar needs to be done for themes that exist simultaneously for a single tactical sequence, or that exist in different lines as competitors to each other.
